    This paper explores the convergence between Clean Architecture and Normalized Systems
    principles and design elements, highlighting their synergistic potential to enhance
    software design and evolvability. The paper draws upon the research described in the
    thesis of \citetitle{koks_convergence_2023} from
    \citename{koks_convergence_2023}{author} through a comparative analysis. It
    demonstrates how each paradigm contributes to modular, maintainable, and evolvable
    software design and how integrating both approaches can lead to a more widely spread
    adoption and an improved software design.
